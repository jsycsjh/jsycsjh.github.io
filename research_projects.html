<p>Below, I describe the major themes of my research.</p>

<h2>Optimization and AutoML</h2>

<p>We showed theoretically how hyperparameter configurations in Stochastic Gradient Descent Momentum connect to the generalization of optimizers, optimized the hyperparameters in a principled fashion, and improved over existing auto-tuners on image classification tasks.</p>



<h2>Adversarial Attacks on Deep Models</h2>

<p>We built an attacker that could jeopardize the interpretation of deep reinforcement learning, and showed theoretically why this attacker is difficult to defend against.</p>


<h2>Correlation Network: A Lightweight Booster for Extreme Multi-label Text Classifier</h2>

<p>We proposed a correlation layer that could be easily added on top of any extreme multi-label text classifier while enhancing its prediction accuracy.</p>


<h2>Multi-directional Attention Learning to Impute Multivariate Time Series</h2>

<p>We proposed an attention-based framework that could effectively capture long-term dependencies between multivariate time series of varying missingness.</p>


<h2>Spatial Temporal Analysis of Multi-Subject, Stimulus-evoked fMRI Data Modeling</h2>

<p>We proposed a low rank multivariate General Linear Model for multi-subject stimulus-evoked fMRI data, implemented efficient optimization algorithm to estimate Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) and to locate activated brain areas. (joint work with Department of Statistics & School of Medicine, University of Virginia)
</p>


<h2>Splicing of Multi-Scale &ldquo;Downscaler&rdquo; Air Quality Surfaces</h2>

<p>We worked on a methodological framework for splicing NOAA regional estimates of &ldquo;Downscaler&rdquo;, EPA's air quality monitoring data fusion product, to create a smooth national surface. (joint work with US EPA)</p>  


<h2>Mediation Process of Online Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) Intervention for Patients with Negative Prospection</h2>

<p>We applied parallel process latent growth curve modeling to study the mediation effect of psychological intervention on negative prospection. (joint work with Department of Psychology, University of Virginia)</p>
